              <p>
                I am currently a master's student in Applied and Computational Mathematics with a specialization in Data Science and optimization at KTH, I am set to receive my degree from KTH in January 2024. 
                Because of my interest in software development and love for Java,  I am also pursuing a degree in Java development in 2024. 
                Balancing two programs at once has taught me to be efficient, handle stress, and manage multiple tasks simultaneously.

              </p>
              <p>
                Through my studies, an internship at Pricer AB as a junior data scientist, and my ongoing master's thesis project, I've developed a solid foundation in math, programming and problem-solving. 
                I've also gained some experience in backend development, particularly using Spring Boot, and I continue to grow my skills in software development.
                I also have high proficiency in GCP tools.

                If you are interested of discussing job opportunites, please do not hesitate to contact me.
                I am available to work remotely or on-site and am open to
                exploring new and challenging projects that will help me grow
                both professionally and personally.
